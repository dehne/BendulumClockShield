This is the more complex of two Arduino shields that implement the hardware interface between an 
Arduino Uno that drives a bendulum clock and the rest of the bendulum clock. The other is the 
EscapementShield. This one is more complex in that it implements a battery backup. If the power 
fails, the clock keeps going!
